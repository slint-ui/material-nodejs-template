# Material Components for Slint Node.js Template

A template for a Node.js Application using Slint with [material components](https://github.com/slint-ui/material-components). Based on the material gallery. 

## About

This template helps you get started developing a JavaScript application with Slint as a toolkit
for the user interface and the material component set. It demonstrates the integration between the `.slint`
UI markup and JavaScript code, how to react to callbacks, get and set properties, and use of all available
material components for Slint.

## Disclaimer

The material components are currently available as a technical preview. Some components are still missing and changes to the api
are possible. We will inform as soon as the component set is read for release.
